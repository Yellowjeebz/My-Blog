This Monday, I had the pleasure of attending my first **Women in Tech Awards**, having made it to the **finals for the Apprentice Award**!  

Though I didn’t win, I was up against some very accomplished fellow apprentices. I’m still delighted to have made it to the finals, and it was amazing to meet so many incredible achievers – bright women with inspiring ideas.  

It was such a motivating experience, and I feel even more encouraged to keep learning, growing, and contributing in the tech world.
